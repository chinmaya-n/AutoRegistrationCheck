This is a software for testing if a vehicle is registered or not
from the AP Transport registration department.

Using:
-----
* Python
* mechanize python library

Installation:
------------
1. Download and install Python.
   a) url: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   b) download the latest version and install it   
2. Download and install Mechanize Python Library:
   a) url: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/download.html
   b) Download a stable release, version at the time of writing: mechanize-0.2.5.tar.gz
   c) Extract the tar.gz file and copy the "mechanize" directory from the mechanize-X.X.X directory.
   d) paste the copied directory to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python2.X\Lib\site-packages". This finishes
      the mechanize insallation.
3. Now Download the latest release of ARC (Automatic Registration Checker)
4. Extract it and place the ARC directory where ever need.
5. 

Note: Here X - means any number (due to versioning)

Issues:
------
No perfect executable or finished user specific build is not yet generated.
Have to learn how to do that a build with mechanize library & with python libs
inbuild.
